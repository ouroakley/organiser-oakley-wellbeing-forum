Come along and share ideas to improve wellbeing

We are a collaboration of existing Oakley groups, individuals and organisations that support our village community.

We actively cooperate, coming together to share ideas, empowering each other and our village.

We aim to improve wellbeing across all ages and social groups within our village community.

We come together as community members to build a common platform to enable residents to connect better with each other and the various activities that take place in our village.

Time commitment is minimal as we meet every two months. We donâ€™t run large projects but rather share and pool ideas to build unity and cooperation between us.
